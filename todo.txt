 TODO
===================

	- check for impact of file diffs and take them into account
	- allowing the user to state that a change is OK and not to highlight it again
	- periodically check for new changes in the repo and warn user about lines
	(- fix utf8 encoded files)
	
	- filters (for users or something like this)

===================
 Research Question
===================

	- Shortcomings of the State of the Art
	- Can we assist in raising change awareness in software development
	- How effective are we?
	
===================
 Study
===================

	- Two groups of students (one using our tool)
	- Each programming a kind of 1 or 2 hour exercise
	- Introducing somehow an error that will be highlighted in the one group because it was contained in the last 5 commits
